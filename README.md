# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

📊 Welcome to our Telecom Customer Churn Prediction project!

## Project Overview

In the fast-paced world of telecommunications, customer churn is a critical challenge. Acquiring new customers is expensive, and intense price wars drive competition. Our project focuses on predicting customer churn, leveraging machine learning techniques to understand and preemptively address this issue.

### Key Features

📈 **Data Analysis:** We dive deep into telecom data, exploring its shape, addressing missing values, and revealing valuable statistical insights.

🤖 **Machine Learning Models:** We employ a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and AdaBoost, to forecast customer churn.

🔍 **Hyperparameter Tuning:** We fine-tune our models with hyperparameters, ensuring precision and reliability.

📋 **User-Defined Function:** For your convenience, we provide a user-defined function to make predictions with your custom data.
