## Visualization Summary

### Boxplot:
- The boxplot, or box-and-whisker plot, is a powerful tool for identifying outliers in our dataset.
- It displays the data's distribution, highlighting key statistics like the median, quartiles, and potential outliers.
- The "box" represents the interquartile range (IQR), which spans the middle 50% of data. The "whiskers" extend to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5 times the IQR from the quartiles.
- Outliers are depicted as individual points beyond this range.
- It helps us grasp the upper and lower tails of our data distribution and understand the spread and skewness of our data.

### Countplot:
- A countplot is a simple yet effective visualization that displays the count of categorical variables.
- It's particularly useful for visualizing the distribution of categorical data, such as the count of customers with international plans or voicemail plans.
- Countplots provide a quick way to understand the distribution of different categories within a variable.

### Heatmap:
- A heatmap is a graphical representation of data that uses a color-coding scheme to visualize the relationship between two variables.
- In our project, we use it to display the Pearson correlation coefficients between different features in our dataset.
- Darker colors indicate stronger positive or negative correlations, helping us identify potential relationships and dependencies between variables.

### ROC Curve:
- The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical representation of a binary classifier's performance.
- It shows the trade-off between the true positive rate (sensitivity) and the false positive rate (1-specificity) across various classification thresholds.
- ROC curves are widely used to assess the performance of classification models, especially in binary classification problems like ours.

These visualizations play a crucial role in our project, providing insights into data distribution, relationships, and model performance.
